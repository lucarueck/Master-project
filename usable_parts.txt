Benchmark:
- fevbench for dataset loading, window sizing and evaluation, but not usable for data preprocessing and modeling 
- Fair fairness benchmark: useful for evaluation fairness, metrics of the benchmark can be used


Existing works:
- Achieving Long Term fairness in sequential decision making
    - Metrics for long- and short-term fairness (see evaluation.py compute statistics)
    - Parts of baseline models see baseline.py (adjusted to time series modeling)
    - maybe the sequential decision making framework can be adapted to time series forecasting, but I currently don't understand in depth how it works
    --> some parts can be useful
    
- CA GAN
    - no model named CA GAN can be found, only baselines smote and WGAN-GP, it is not clear which model is CA GAN
    - the data named "data_ca_gan" used in the evaluations are not created or provided in any of the files
    - models and data can currently not be reconstructed from the provided code (if it can, code can be used)
    --> some parts can be useful

- FairST (EquiTensor)
    - already outperformed
    - I can see fairness objective in code but do not understand them fully
    --> it's unlikely that parts can be used

- FairFor
    - Github repo seems to be incomplete, can not find FairFor model implementation
    --> nothing can be used

- Fairness in LDS
    - Learning objectives can be useful
    - LDS are applicable to time series of different lengths (not a frequently appearing use case, only model that can to this)
    --> some parts can be useful

- Steer (Learning Time Series EHR)
    - very complex code, not reproducible as data is missing
    --> it's unlikely that parts can be used



Existing works without an implementation:
- BAHT
    - use simple methods for bias mitigation, the approach can be reconstructed
    
- FairTP
    - try to reconstruct targeted sampling, but could be complicated

- SA-Net
    - fairness objective MAPE can be adopted

- Absolute Correlation regularization
    - two fairness objective for regularization can be adopted

- FairSTG
    - too complicated and not suitable as the approach focus on spatial data

- HiMoE
    - too complicated to reconstruct the model




Benchmark:

Agree one one model (research, currently TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer or LSTM))

1. Simple TFT/LSTM model
2. Smote for synthetic data generation for underrepresented groups + TFT/LSTM model     --> CA-GAN
3. TFT/LSTM model + regularization term (correlation, variance)        --> Absolute Correlation Regularization, FairST, Fairness criteria for LDS, SA-Net
4. Oversampling/Undersampling strategies + TFT/LSTM model          --> BAHT
5. Sampling strategy (data from groups that performs worse more often are sampled more frequently) + TFT/LSTM model      --> FairTP
6. Exclude sensitive information + TFT/LSTM Model               --> STEER
7. Check if long term fairness work can be adopted         --> Achieving Long Term fairness in sequential decision making
8. Check if there is sth like information transfer from difficult to easy to learn samples  --> FairSTG

Own approach:
If underrepresented groups: 
    Use best representation bias mitigation technique from above (sampling, synthetic data generation) 
+ best regularization technique from above

Not used --> HiMoE (Mixture of Experts), FairFor (currently to complicated, 4 steps, adversarial learning + representation learning)
